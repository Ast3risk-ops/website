- I use [**Umami Analytics**](https://umami.is) (self hosted at `t.asterisk.lol`) on this site. These are anonymous, privacy-conscious analytics that give me basic metrics. To view what kinds of data I collect, see the [**Umami demo**](https://analytics.umami.is/share/LGazGOecbDtaIwDr/umami.is).

- I also use [**Cloudflare Browser Insights**](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/website-optimization/) to measure how fast pages load for users (only works on Chromium-based browsers for now).

- My comments section is powered by **Github** and is subject to the [**Github Privacy Policy**](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

- Any external embeds will be subject to their respective terms.

- Any local image files are hosted on [**Cloudflare Pages**](https://pages.cloudflare.com) alongside the rest of the site. Cloudflare's [**privacy policy**](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) applies.

<!-- - The footer badge is hosted on Rimgo (privacy-friendly Imgur frontend, lunar.icu instance) and their [privacy policy](https://rimgo.lunar.icu/privacy) applies. -->
