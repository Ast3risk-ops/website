### License Exemptions

In each case, you must also follow the other terms of [the license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/deed.en), this mainly concerns itself with exemptions to the **NC** (non-commercial) part of [the license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/deed.en).

| --------------------------------------------------------- |:----------------------------------:|
| A YouTube video?                                          | If it's monetized *in any way*, [contact me](/socials) for an exemption.       |
| A podcast?                                                | If there are ads, [contact me](/socials) for an exemption. |
| An AI-written post (for money or not, it doesn't matter)? | **NO.**                            |
| A paid blog post/Post on a blog with ads?                 | [Contact me](/socials) for an exemption.            |

I mainly don't want people directly making money from my work.

However, it is still recommended you [contact me](/socials) if you want an exemption not covered here or have any licensing questions.
