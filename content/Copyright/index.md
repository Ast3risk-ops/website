Here's a summary of [the license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/deed.en):

If you wish to use the content in this blog (which you are free to do in any medium or format as dictated by [the license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/deed.en)) you must:

- Attribute me as the original author, and not shoveled away at the bottom of a description page, make it obvious (in the video, podcast, or text itself).

- You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally or practically restrict others from doing anything [the license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en) permits.

- Fair use and fair dealing [still apply](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#do-creative-commons-licenses-affect-exceptions-and-limitations-to-copyright-such-as-fair-dealing-and-fair-use).

- You may not [remix, transform, or build upon](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#when-is-my-use-considered-an-adaptation) my content (changing the format does not constitute an adaptation) unless the adaptation falls under fair use.

I have added the following additional restriction, justified through my [robots.txt](/robots.txt) file:

- Even though you may use my content commercially, ***No AI crawlers may use my content.*** See below for details.

## Generative AI (ChatGPT)

My content is 100% human-written and will always be that way. As a testament to this, I use the badge below:

To learn more, and get this badge for yourself, visit [**notbyai**](https://notbyai.fyi/).

I also do not want AI to use my work. AI cannot write with passion, as it has no intelligence. It just plays word games and creates unoriginal content.

You can see by AI bot blocklist rules in [`robots.txt`](/robots.txt).
