### License FAQ

| Can I use the content on...                      |                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------- |:----------------------------------:|
| A YouTube video?                                          | Yes, but you must follow the rules.       |
| A podcast?                                                | If there are ads or sponsorships, [contact me](/socials) for an exemption. |
| An AI-written post (for money or not, it doesn't matter)? | **NO.**                            |
| A paid blog post/Post on a blog with ads?                 | [Contact me](/socials) for an exemption.            |

I mainly don't want people directly making money from my work.

However, it is still recommended you [contact me](/socials) if you want an exemption not covered here or have any licensing questions.

### Youtube Rules

{{< alert icon="circle-info" cardColor="#1e3a8a" textColor="#f5f6fa" iconColor="#60a5fa" >}}
For platforms like Peertube where you can freely set any license, normal rules apply. If it has ads or sponsorships, it's commercial use.
{{< /alert >}}

You must set your video license to **Creative Commons - Attribution**, then have a bit in the description stating that the *actual* license is **CC BY-NC-SA** with a link to [the deed](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en).

If you are a member of the **Youtube Partner Program** and/or your video is sponsored; you must follow fair use instead of this license as your video is considered commercial use. If you cannot follow fair use, you will need to [contact me](/socials) for an exemption.

## Generative AI (ChatGPT)

My content is 100% human-written and will always be that way. As a testament to this, I use the badge below:

I also do not want AI to use my work. AI cannot write with passion, as it has no intelligence. It just plays word games and creates unoriginal content.

You can see by AI bot blocklist rules in [`robots.txt`](/robots.txt).
