## Me and VR

I own a Quest 2 which I've had for a while. This thing was my gateway to all kinds of new experiences, but mostly games.

<the-fold></the-fold>

I felt it was important to get my hands on one of these, because being in VR and watching someone's VR gameplay are two very different things. You have to try VR to really understand what makes it so interesting.

I initially got this to try out games like Pavlov Shack and I Expect You to Die.

I was also enticed by a program called Immersed offering a full work solution in VR with virtual monitors.

### Immersed

Immersed was one of the first things I tried on my headset, besides games.

The tool had a very interesting premise, the idea that I could get more done *in VR*.

The setup experience was nice, I don't have a supported Bluetooth keyboard so I just have to use crappy passthrough over the keyboard I have.

The key with using Immersed is to make your screens bigger. I felt that text was still a bit blurry even when it was big, and the hot, heavy headset meant I couldn't really stay in the headset for very long.

### Softspace

VR has been entering new heights recently. What spurred me to write this post was mainly the release of [Softspace](https://soft.space), a VR spatial computing app. Make no mistake, this isn't Bigscreen or Immersed, this is for *notes*.

Here, you're able to live within your notes, moving them around in a 3D space.

You can also easily create and manage different topics, and view an AI overview of your ideas.

![Softspace Idea View](posts/vr/softspace_ideas.gif "Idea Mode ([Softspace](https://building.soft.space/i/136188294/ai-powered-features-for-insight-and-inspiration))")

So far all I've shown is marketing material (and the UI shown in them is out of date?). I just want to set the stage for what *I* saw in the product. The marketing convinced me and I decided to pull out my Quest 2 and try it.

Now, I think the Quest 2's virtual keyboard is *fine*, but the Softspace one is *abysmal*. That combined with the fact that I'm writing longer paragraphs, means I had to use the **web keyboard** functionality. It's where you take another device and point it to this website which redirects all inputs to your headset.

## Growth of VR

### Gaming

Consumer-ready immersive VR's first foray was gaming. 80s VR demos that people thought were mind-blowing were *games*.

![Hand Staring](posts/vr/handstare.jpg "Hand Staring Competition (NASA)")

That up there was a NASA tech demo from the 80s for a VR game where you stare at *your hand*. The idea was something else, a fully virtual world you could look around and *see*.

Video games can push any new technology to its limits, it did so with personal computers, and continues to do so with VR.

What got people to suffer through the MS-DOS command prompt were games like Wolfenstein 3D or DOOM. They booted up Windows 98 for Half-Life, because they *had* to see those jawdropping graphics and animations for themselves Having an incentive like that to try a new technology can open peoples' eyes up to its other possibilities.

It wasn't until the Oculus Rift in 2016 that people really began to see the possibilities, even if it did initially come with an Xbox controller.

Job Simulator came out shortly after the Rift (and after motion controllers were added ðŸ‘‡).

![Oculus Touch Controllers](posts/vr/oculus-controllers.jpg "Oculus Touch Controllers ([Evan Amos](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Evan-Amos))")

It showed people VR's possibilities by allowing them to do things they already recognized, *jobs*.

![Job Simulator](posts/vr/jobsim.jpg "Job Simulator ([Owlchemy Labs](https://store.steampowered.com/app/448280/Job_Simulator/))")

A year (ish) later, I Expect You To Die (mentioned already) let people roleplay as a secret agent solving fun puzzles with telekenesis. I always wanted to play this game at some point since I was a kid.

![I Expect You To Die](posts/vr/ieytd2.jpg "I Expect You To Die ([Schell Games](https://store.steampowered.com/app/587430/I_Expect_You_To_Die/))")

As a kid I actually got to try a Rift at my local library, where I played Job Simulator. The Rift's "default" display when loading (*image missing*) always freaked me out. It was a white void (similar to the white dome steamVR background, hell, maybe it *was* that) where all you could see were the two room trackers and your controllers, just floating there.

The tracking also wasn't the greatest, so your hands could clip into the walls of the environment sometimes, and it scared me to death.
