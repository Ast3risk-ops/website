## The Beginning

I used to use the [HBS theme](https://hbs.razonyang.com/v1/en/), which had a lot of features and utilities.

It had everything I needed, and I was happy with it. I also had a horrible [carrd site](https://ast3risk-ops.carrd.co) that haunts me to this day.

I wrote posts here, and the arragmenet worked, but eventually I went looking for a theme to replace my main site and ended up finding Blowfish.
