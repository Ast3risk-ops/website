## The Beginning

I used to use the [HBS theme](https://hbs.razonyang.com/v1/en/), which had a lot of features and utilities.

![old-blog](old-blog.png "What the old blog [used to look like](https://web.archive.org/web/20240105161828/https://blog.asterisk.lol/).")

It had everything I needed, and I was happy with it. I also had a horrible [carrd site](https://web.archive.org/web/20240123185248/https://ast3risk-ops.carrd.co/) that haunts me to this day.

![carrd](carrd.png "My [old carrd site](https://web.archive.org/web/20240123185248/https://ast3risk-ops.carrd.co/).")

I wrote posts here, and the arrangement worked, but eventually I went looking for a theme to replace my main site.

I looked in a lot of places. Ghost, Astro, Nuxt, even WordPress.

Eventually I thought about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but I couldn't find any good themes. However, it did introduce me to [jamstackthemes](https://jamstackthemes.dev), where I kept digging through Jekyll and Astro themes.

Eventually I decided to go back to browsing Hugo themes, and after a lot of digging and testing, I ended up finding [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page).

It seemed really powerful and robust, and had a [configuration tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blowfish-tools) available, and the [examples](https://blowfish.page/users/) blew me away.

## Initial Struggles

Initially, the theme did not work correctly, displaying a 404 every time. 

![404](404.png ":sob:")

I actually made a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish/issues/1184) for this, but found a quick fix on my own; I forgot to uncomment `theme = "blowfish"` in `config.toml` :facepalm:.

Once I got it working, I had to start configuring it, something I spent days on.

## Building the site

### Basics

I started with the basics like a title, icon, socials, etc, which the tool did well.

### Theme

Eventually I set a background image and chose a colour scheme. I looked through the [available ones](https://blowfish.page/docs/getting-started/#colour-schemes), and chose Congo[^1] as a holdover until I could make my own, because it looked very similar to my old blog.

However, I just ended up sticking with it.

Setting up the menus and icons was a real breeze, and adding more was easy (more on that soon:tm:).

### Deployment

Deployment was fairly easy, no special Hugo flags required. The only caveat was I had to disable Cloudflare's [Rocket Loader:tm:](https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/rocket-loader/) to fix the appearance switcher.

### Icons

This theme comes with a very small subset of icons from FontAwesome 6 Free. However, there is an easy procedure for adding more.

All I had to go was go to FontAwesome's [icon page](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free), search for an icon, and download it into <mark>assets/icons</mark>. I will be using the Discord icon from `fa-brands` as an example.

![fas-search](fas-search.png "A world of free icons awaits...")


![fas-dl](fas-dl.png "So easy!")

From there it *does* get a bit more complicated, as you now have to edit the SVG file.

Using our Discord SVG as an example (normally this would be minified onto a single line), we need to add `fill="currentColor"` to our `path` attribute, turning this:

{{< highlight xml "linenos=table" >}}

That's really easy! And now it follows our current color scheme and will work like any other icon! I already use this feature in lots of places in this website. 

Technically you can pull from any icon set you want, I just prefer to use FontAwesome 6 as it fits the rest of the site, however [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org) also works well if you need more brand icons.

You can find more icon sets at [Icones](https://icones.js.org).
