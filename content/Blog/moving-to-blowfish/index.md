## The Beginning

I used to use the [HBS theme](https://hbs.razonyang.com/v1/en/), which had a lot of features and utilities.

It had everything I needed, and I was happy with it. I also had a horrible [carrd site](https://web.archive.org/web/20240123185248/https://ast3risk-ops.carrd.co/) that haunts me to this day.

I wrote posts here, and the arrangement worked, but eventually I went looking for a theme to replace my main site and ended up finding Blowfish.

## Initial Struggles

Initially, the theme did not work correctly, displaying a 404 every time. I actually made a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish/issues/1184) for this, but found a quick fix on my own; I forgot to uncomment `theme = "blowfish"` in `config.toml`. :facepalm:
